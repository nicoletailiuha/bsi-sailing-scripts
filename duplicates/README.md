This is a script to help find duplicates in registrations for sailings.

In order to launch it, you need to have `node` and `npm` installed locally.
Instructions for that can be found here for different OS: `https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm`. The commands need to be run in a terminal window.

After that, in the folder that you have downloaded the project, run `npm i` in order to install the required packages to make this work.

Once the packages are installed, run `node index.js` in the same folder and watch the magic happen :)
